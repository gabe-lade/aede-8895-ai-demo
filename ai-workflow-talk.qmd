## Two observations and a question

::: {.incremental}
1. AI has made it **virtually costless** to write grammatically correct prose with no spelling errors.

2. AI has given everyone a **(near) Ph.D.-level** coding assistant and data analyst.
:::

::: {.larger-text}
*What is the equilibrium response for economics job market candidates?*
:::

## A few thoughts

- The average quality (and expectations) of a JMP will be **higher every year**
- Expectations for **more complex analyses** will increase
- Bad writing will likely become a **very bad signal**
- Boring/generic writing will signal **overreliance on AI**
- **Interpersonal skills** will become more critical

. . .

**Today's focus:** Building an AI-augmented research infrastructure

## Finding the Balance {.smaller}

**1. Learn the fundamentals** — You can't evaluate code you don't understand. AI will confidently give you wrong answers—you need to catch them. Think of AI as a fast RA who occasionally hallucinates.

**2. But don't fall behind** — Your peers *are* using these tools. The productivity gap compounds quickly. "I prefer the old way" is not a competitive strategy.

**3. The old system was imperfect** — Research errors happened before AI—and were caught late or not at all. Better workflows + AI review can catch errors earlier.

. . .

The goal isn't "AI vs. no AI"—it's building systems that make research **more robust, faster, and more replicable**.

## The old system wasn't a gold standard {.smaller}

**Case 1: Reinhart & Rogoff (2010)** — An Excel formula didn't include 5 rows of data. Paper claimed high debt causes -0.1% growth; corrected: +2.2% growth. Used to justify global austerity. Found by a grad student, 3 years later.

**Case 2: Deschênes & Greenstone (2007 AER)** — Coding errors and missing weather data in climate-agriculture analysis. Paper claimed climate change would *increase* ag profits; corrected results showed the opposite. Found 5 years later via replication.

## 1. Use a cloud platform + clear folder structure

Work from **OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive**—not your local machine alone. A consistent folder structure makes AI tools more effective because they can understand your project organization. This also enables collaboration and automatic backup simultaneously.

```
project-folder/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── clean/
├── code/
│   ├── 01-clean.R
│   ├── 02-analysis.R
│   └── 03-figures.R
├── output/
├── paper/
└── README.md
```

## 2. Use Git/GitHub for version control

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Why Git?

- Track every change to your code
- Revert to any previous version
- See exactly what changed and when
- Collaborate without overwriting
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Why GitHub?

- Cloud backup of your code history
- Share and collaborate easily
- AI tools integrate directly with repos
- Replication packages ready to share
:::

::::

. . .

```{.bash}
git diff analysis.R
```
```{.diff}
- model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)
+ model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2, data = df)  # added interaction
```

::: {.center-text}
No more `analysis_v3_final_FINAL2.R` — Git tracks it all.
:::

## 3. Use AI coding tools: Claude Code vs. Cursor {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Claude Code

**What:** Terminal-based, agentic coding assistant

**Best for:** R and data analysis workflows, file operations & project setup, autonomous multi-step tasks, Git integration

*Runs from command line, can execute code and modify files directly.*
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Cursor

**What:** AI-powered code editor (VS Code fork)

**Best for:** Iterative code editing, larger software projects, inline suggestions while typing, tab completion on steroids

*Full IDE experience with AI built in.*
:::

::::

## 4. Write papers in Overleaf + GitHub

- **Overleaf** = collaborative LaTeX editing in the browser
- **GitHub sync** = version control for your paper
- AI tools can help draft, edit, and format LaTeX
- Figures from code → paper in one pipeline

**The workflow:**

Code (R/Python) → Figures & Tables → GitHub Repo → Overleaf Paper

*One integrated system: Code changes automatically flow through to your paper.*

## Cautions & Pitfalls

1. **AI can hallucinate packages and functions** — It will confidently suggest code using libraries that don't exist. Always run and verify.

2. **Don't let AI do your economic thinking** — It's a tool, not a co-author. Identification, intuition, and interpretation are yours.

3. **Always test AI-generated code** — Run it. Check edge cases. Verify results make sense.

4. **Be thoughtful about sensitive data** — Know what data you're sending to AI services. Check your IRB and data use agreements.
