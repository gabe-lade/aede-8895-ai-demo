[AI in Your Research]{.title-text}
:::


## Think, Pair, Share 

For the following use cases, discuss whether you think AI is appropriate to use as part of your research:

- Developing research questions/ideas
- Coding
- Theoretical modeling and derivations
- Editing
- Writing
- Summarizing (post-publication)

[Let's Get More Specific!]{.title-text}
:::



## Is the following use of AI appropriate? 

::: {.discussion-box}
You use AI to **rewrite paragraphs** you've already written to make them sound more professional and improve grammar.
:::




## Is the following use of AI appropriate? 

::: {.discussion-box}
You ask AI to **write code** to merge two datasets and run a standard regression based on your natural language instructions. You check the code and it seems correct.
:::



## Is the following use of AI appropriate? 

::: {.discussion-box}
You ask AI to **"summarize the top 10 most influential papers on [X]."** You use this summary to develop your literature review in a paper.
:::


## Is the following use of AI appropriate? 

::: {.discussion-box}
You ask AI to **propose three novel research questions based on the gap in the literature between Paper X and Paper Y.**  You choose one and it becomes the basis for your paper for your dissertation.
:::




## Is the following use of AI appropriate? 

::: {.discussion-box}
Your advisor asks you to **review a paper** for the AJAE. You upload the paper to AI and ask it to review the paper. You use these as the primary critiques of the paper.

[My Thoughts on AI]{.title-text}
:::


## Two observations and a question

1. AI has made it **virtually costless** to write grammatically correct prose with no spelling errors.

2. AI has given everyone a **(near) Ph.D.-level** coding assistant and data analyst.

What is the equilibrium response for economics job market candidates?
:::


## A few thoughts on the job market

- The average quality (and expectations) of a JMP will be **higher every year**
- Expectations for **more complex analyses** will increase
- Bad writing will likely become a **very bad signal**
- Boring/generic writing will signal **overreliance on AI**
- **Interpersonal skills** will become more critical


## Finding the balance 

**1. Learn the fundamentals** — You can't evaluate code you don't understand. AI will confidently give you wrong answers—you need to catch them. Think of AI as a fast RA who occasionally hallucinates.

**2. But don't fall behind** — Your peers *are* using these tools. The productivity gap compounds quickly. "I prefer the old way" is not a competitive strategy.

**3. The old system was imperfect** — Research errors happened before AI—and were caught late or not at all. Better workflows + AI review can catch errors earlier.


## Finding the balance 

<br><br>

::: {.larger-text}

The goal isn't "AI vs. no AI"—it's building systems that make research **more robust, faster, and more replicable**.

[Building Your Stack]{.title-text}
:::


## 1. Use a cloud platform + clear folder structure

Work from **OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive**—not your local machine alone. 

A consistent folder structure makes AI tools more effective because they can understand your project organization. 

```
project-folder/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── clean/
├── code/
│   ├── 01-clean.R
│   ├── 02-analysis.R
│   └── 03-figures.R
├── output/
├── paper/
└── README.md
```


## 2. Use Git/GitHub for version control

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Why Git?

- Track every change to your code
- Revert to any previous version
- See exactly what changed and when
- Collaborate without overwriting
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Why GitHub?

- Cloud backup of your code history
- Share and collaborate easily
- AI tools integrate directly with repos
- Replication packages ready to share
:::

::::

## 2. Use Git/GitHub for version control

No more `analysis_v3_final_FINAL2.R` — Git tracks it all.

<br>

```{.bash}
git diff analysis.R
```
```{.diff}
- model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)
+ model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2, data = df)  # added interaction
```

<br>

## 3. Use AI coding tools: Claude Code vs. Cursor 
<br> 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Claude Code

**What:** Terminal-based, agentic coding assistant

**Best for:** Data analysis workflows, file operations & project setup, autonomous multi-step tasks, Git integration

**Runs from command line**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Cursor

**What:** AI-powered code editor 

**Best for:** Iterative code editing, larger software projects, inline suggestions while typing, tab completion on steroids

:::

::::


## 4. Write papers in Overleaf + GitHub

**Overleaf** = collaborative LaTeX editing in the browser

**GitHub sync** = version control for your paper

<br>

**The workflow:**

Code  → Figures & Tables → GitHub Repo → Overleaf Paper

<br>

**One integrated system: Code changes automatically flow through to your paper.**


## Cautions & pitfalls

1. **AI will make errors and add analyses/code you didn't ask it to** — It will confidently change code that generates plausible-looking results but be completely wrong.

2. **Don't let AI do your economic thinking** — It's a tool, not a co-author. Identification, intuition, and interpretation are yours.

3. **Always test AI-generated code** — Run it. Check edge cases. Verify results make sense.

4. **Be thoughtful about sensitive data** — Know what data you're sending to AI services.
